# Tumor Microenvironment Clustering using Statistical Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Tumors are not uniform; different regions exhibit varying biological
conditions such as immune activity, oxygen availability, and growth behavior.
This project simulates a tumor microenvironment and applies unsupervised
machine learning to discover heterogeneous spatial regions.

## Dataset Description
A synthetic dataset of 400 tumor regions was generated.
Each region includes:
- Spatial coordinates (x, y)
- Immune activity
- Structural support
- Oxygen availability
- Blood supply
- Growth rate

Synthetic data enables controlled experimentation and interpretability.

## Methodology
- Feature standardization using StandardScaler
- Unsupervised clustering using K-Means
- Spatial visualization of discovered clusters
- Cluster-wise feature interpretation

## Results & Interpretation
The model identified distinct tumor microenvironment regions, including:
- Immune-dominant areas
- Hypoxic (low-oxygen) regions
- Support-heavy zones
- Mixed transitional regions

These findings demonstrate tumor heterogeneity and the importance of
region-level analysis.
